# EXPERIMENT 1- INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
# AIM 
 To understand the basis of python programming and write simple programs.
# THEORY
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is designed to be simple, readable, and easy to learn, making it popular among beginners and professionals.

1. TOPICS TO BE COVERED

   a) Python installation, IDLE/Pycharm/Jupiter Notebook

   b) Variable and Data types

   c) Input and Output

   d) Operators

   e) Conditional Statements (if,else,elif)

   f) Loops(for,while)

   g) Functions

   h) Basic Problem Sloving

3. Python Execution Modes-Interactive Mode-Commands are executed one line at a time, immediate output is displayed and useful for testing small code snippets and learning.

4. Variables and Identifiers-A variable is a named memory location used to store data values.Rules for Identifiers:Must start with a letter (A–Z, a–z) or underscore _, cannot start with a digit, case-sensitive and should not use Python keywords

5. Data Types in Python-Python provides several built-in data types to store different kinds of data.Basic Data Types-Integer (int): Whole numbers, Floating-point (float): Decimal numbers, String (str): Sequence of characters and Boolean (bool): True or False.The data type of a variable can be identified using the type() function.

6. Operators and Expressions:Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.Types of Operators-Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations(+, -, *, /, %), Relational Operators: Used for comparison(>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=), Logical Operators: Used to combine conditions(and, or, not), Assignment Operators: Used to assign values (=, +=, -=, *=, /=) and Bitwise Operators: Perform operations at bit level(&, |, ^, <<, >>). An expression is a combination of operators and operands that produces a result.

7. Print- The print() function is a simple and powerful way to display information in Python. It helps in showing results, debugging programs, and interacting with users.

8. APPLICATIONS OF PYTHON-Web development, Data science and Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Automation and scripting, Game development, Scientific computing and Desktop applications

# Algorithm-1
First value of r is taken from the user and then math library is imported which automatically calculates the value of pi in the formula of area of circle and then prints the value.
1. Start
2. Taking the value of radius from the user
3. importing math library
4. Putting the formula of area of circle
5. Printing the area
6. End

# Algorithm-2
First math library is imported which calculates the value of log10 base 10 value.
1. Start
2. importing math library
3. printing the value of log10 base 10
4. End

# CONCLUSION
Python is a powerful, simple, and versatile programming language that is easy to learn and widely used in many fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and software development. Its clear syntax helps beginners understand programming concepts quickly, while its large collection of libraries makes it useful for solving real-world problems efficiently. With strong community support and cross-platform compatibility.
