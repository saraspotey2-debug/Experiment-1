# AIM 
 To understand the basis of python programming and write simple programs.
# THEORY
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is designed to be simple, readable, and easy to learn, making it popular among beginners and professionals.
# TOPICS TO BE COVERED
1. Python installation, IDLE/Pycharm/Jupiter Notebook
2. Variable and Data types
3. Input and Output
4. Operators
5. Conditional Statements (if,else,elif)
6. Loops(for,while)
7. Functions
8. Basic Problem Sloving
# CODE-1
In code 1,variables are declared with strings and we want only the string of x so print x.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. Initiallising the strings to variables
3. Printing x
4. End 
# CODE-2
In x integer is declared, in y floating point is declared, in z and w string and boolean value is put and to know its type command print(type(x)) etc is put.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start 
2. putting the integer, float, string and boolean in x,y,z and w respectively.
3. printing the type of x,y,z and w
4. End
# CODE-3
values are assigned to x and y and different operations are performed for example- addition,subtraction, multiplication etc.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. declaring values of x and y in one line
3. Performing various operations like addition, subtraction etc and printing the result
4. End
# CODE-4
Values are taken from the user and then the operations are performed.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. Taking the values of x and y from the user
3. Performing different operations and printing the results.
4. End
# CODE-5
First value of r is taken from the user and then math library is imported which automatically calculates the value of pi in the formula of area of circle and then prints the value.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. Taking the value of radius from the user
3. importing math library
4. Putting the formula of area of circle
5. Printing the area
6. End
# CODE-6
First math library is imported which calculates the value of log10 base 10 value.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. importing math library
3. printing the value of log10 base 10
4. End
# CODE-7
Initiallzing the value of a and b and then checking wheather a is greater than b or not by using if else statement.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. initiallising the values of a and b
3. Checking wheather b is greater than a or not using if else statement
4. End 
# DIFFERENT DATA TYPES IN PYTHON:
1.int – whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5)
2.float – decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)
3.complex – complex numbers (e.g., 2+3j)
4.bool – True or False
5.str – text / characters (e.g., "Hello")
6.list – ordered, changeable collection (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
7.tuple – ordered, unchangeable collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
8.set – unordered, unique values (e.g., {1, 2, 3})
9.dict – key–value pairs (e.g., {"a": 1})
# FEATURES OF PYTHON:
Simple and readable syntax – code looks close to English.
Interpreted language – no need to compile; runs line by line.
High-level language – no need to manage memory manually.
Object-oriented – supports classes and objects.
Portable – runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.
Free and open source
Large standard library – provides built-in modules for many tasks.
# APPLICATIONS OF PYTHON
Web development 
Data science and Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence
Automation and scripting
Game development
Scientific computing
Desktop applications
# ADVANTAGES OF PYTHON
Easy to learn and use
Requires fewer lines of code
Faster development
Large community support
# CONCLUSION
Python is a powerful, simple, and versatile programming language that is easy to learn and widely used in many fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and software development. Its clear syntax helps beginners understand programming concepts quickly, while its large collection of libraries makes it useful for solving real-world problems efficiently. With strong community support and cross-platform compatibility, Python is an excellent choice for students and professionals to start their programming journey and build reliable, scalable applications.                                                          
Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language widely used in modern technology fields such as AI, data science, and web development.
NoneType – represents no value (None)
