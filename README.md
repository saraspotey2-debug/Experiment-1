                                                   Introduction to python
                                                                  
                                                           #Theory
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is designed to be simple, readable, and easy to learn, making it popular among beginners and professionals.

Code-1- In code 1,variables are declared with strings and we want want only the string of x so print x.

Code-2-In x integer is declared, in y floating point is declared, in z and w string and boolean value is put and to know its type command print(type(x)) etc is put.

Code-3- values are assigned to x and y and different operations are performed for example- addition,subtraction, multiplication ect.

Code-4- Values are taken from the user and then the operations are performed.

Code-5- First value of r is taken from the user and then math library is imported which automatically calculates the value of pi in the formula of area of circle and then prints the value.

Code-6- First math library is impported which calculates the value of log10 base 10 value.

Code-7- Initiallzing the value of a and b and then checking wheather a is greater than b or not by using if else statement.

different data types in Python:

int – whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5)

float – decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)

complex – complex numbers (e.g., 2+3j)

bool – True or False

str – text / characters (e.g., "Hello")

list – ordered, changeable collection (e.g., [1, 2, 3])

tuple – ordered, unchangeable collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3))

set – unordered, unique values (e.g., {1, 2, 3})

dict – key–value pairs (e.g., {"a": 1})

Features of Python

Simple and readable syntax – code looks close to English.

Interpreted language – no need to compile; runs line by line.

High-level language – no need to manage memory manually.

Object-oriented – supports classes and objects.

Portable – runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.

Free and open source

Large standard library – provides built-in modules for many tasks.
